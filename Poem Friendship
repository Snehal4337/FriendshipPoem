Friendship is a golden chain,
The links are friends so dear,
And like a rare and precious jewel
It’s treasured more each year.

It’s clasped together firmly
With a love that’s deep and true,
And it’s rich with happy memories
And fond recollections, too
Time can’t destroy its beauty
For as long as memory lives,
Years can’t erase the pleasure
That the joy of friendship gives.
