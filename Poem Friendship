Friendship is a golden chain,
The links are friends so dear,
And like a rare and precious jewel
It’s treasured more each year.

It takes more than caring
To be a real friend
The nature of friendship
Requires a blend
Of warmest compassion
And love deep and true
To reach and to comfort
The way that you do
Because I can see
That your kind of friendship
Is priceless to me.

It’s clasped together firmly
With a love that’s deep and true,
And it’s rich with happy memories
And fond recollections, too
Time can’t destroy its beauty
For as long as memory lives,
Years can’t erase the pleasure
That the joy of friendship gives.
